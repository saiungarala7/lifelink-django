# LifeLink: Online Blood Donation Platform

A comprehensive Django-based web application for connecting blood donors, blood banks, and patients. Built as a final-year academic project with real-time chat functionality and location-aware features.

## Features

### 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Three distinct roles**: Donor, Blood Bank, Patient
- Separate dashboards for each role
- Role-specific access restrictions using decorators

### 📍 Location-Aware System
- Real-time geolocation capture using Browser Geolocation API
- Stores latitude, longitude, and location name

- Eligibility checking (90-day rule, age restrictions)
- Availability toggle (ON/OFF)
- Donation scheduling with nearby blood banks
- Donation history tracking

### 🏥 Blood Bank Module
- Blood inventory management (add, remove, update units)
- Low stock alerts
- View scheduled donors
- Mark donations as completed
- Automatic inventory updates on completion

### 🧑‍🦱 Patient Module
- Search donors by blood group and distance
- Search blood banks with available units
- Filter by availability status
- Distance-based results

### 💬 Real-Time Chat System
- One-to-one WebSocket-based chat
- Patient ↔ Donor
- Patient ↔ Blood Bank
- Donor ↔ Blood Bank
- Real-time message delivery
- Chat history stored in database

## Academic Features Demonstrated

✅ Clean, modular code structure
✅ RBAC implementation with decorators
✅ Real-time features (WebSocket chat)
✅ Location-aware search with distance calculation
✅ Django ORM and models
✅ Bootstrap 5 UI
✅ Django Channels integration
✅ Donor eligibility logic
✅ Inventory management
✅ Audit trails (created_at, updated_at fields)

## Important Notes

- This is an academic project, not for production use
- Location capture requires HTTPS in production (HTTP works in development)
- Chat uses InMemoryChannelLayer (use Redis for production)
- SQLite is used for simplicity (use PostgreSQL for production)

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- AI recommendations
- Payment integration
- Google Maps UI integration
- Mobile app
- SMS/Email notifications
- Advanced analytics
